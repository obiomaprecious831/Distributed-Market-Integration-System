# Distributed Market Integration System (DMIS)

## Overview
DMIS is an advanced platform for coordinating, integrating, and optimizing economic activities across disparate and isolated market systems. It provides a comprehensive framework for cross-market value exchange, predictive market analytics, resource optimization, and systemic risk management across disconnected economic domains.

## Core Components

### Cross-System Exchange Protocol
- Facilitates value transfer between isolated market systems
- Implements universal asset classification standards
- Provides automated exchange rate determination
- Manages settlement across system boundaries
- Handles multi-currency escrow mechanisms
- Maintains transaction integrity verification

### Divergence Prediction Markets
- Enables speculation on branching decision outcomes
- Implements probabilistic futures contracts
- Provides automated market making for low-liquidity predictions
- Manages outcome verification protocols
- Handles conditional settlement mechanisms
- Maintains historical accuracy metrics

### Resource Equilibrium Engine
- Manages supply-demand balance across isolated systems
- Implements dynamic resource allocation algorithms
- Provides scarcity detection and mitigation
- Coordinates cross-system resource transfers
- Handles regulatory compliance across domains
- Maintains resource optimization modeling

### Systemic Risk Management Framework
- Provides risk assessment for catastrophic system failures
- Implements distributed insurance protocols
- Manages collateralization of high-risk positions
- Coordinates collective hedging strategies
- Handles automated claim verification and settlement
- Maintains systemic stability reserves

## Technical Requirements
- Rust 1.70+
- Golang 1.21+
- PostgreSQL 15+ with TimescaleDB
- Redis 7.0+
- Hardware:
    - 64+ CPU cores
    - 256GB+ RAM
    - 4TB+ NVMe storage
    - TPU/GPU acceleration (recommended)

## Installation
```bash
# Install core system
cargo install dmis-core

# Install market tools
go install github.com/dmis/tools/market@latest

# Initialize the platform
dmis-init --config=/path/to/config.yaml
```

## Quick Start

1. Initialize an exchange node:
```rust
use dmis_core::exchange;

let node = ExchangeNode::new(NodeConfig {
    id: "exchange-001",
    capacity: TPS(100000),
    settlement_frequency: Seconds(10),
    reserve_ratio: 0.15,
});
```

2. Configure cross-system trading:
```rust
let exchange = CrossSystemExchange::new(ExchangeConfig {
    supported_systems: vec!["Alpha", "Beta", "Gamma"],
    base_currency: "Universal Credit",
    slippage_tolerance: 0.005,
    oracle_sources: vec!["OracleA", "OracleB", "OracleC"],
});
```

3. Initialize prediction markets:
```rust
let predictions = PredictionMarket::new(MarketConfig {
    resolution_period: Days(30),
    market_maker_funds: Millions(10.0),
    fee_percentage: 0.01,
    max_outcome_count: 20,
});
```
